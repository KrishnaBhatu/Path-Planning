(#Comment: We tried using rand_r() and srand() functions, but they are pseudo random 
functions and it produces same random number for the seed provided. We also tried 
using time as a seed, but since this function is called within a second, time 
seed also remains constant. As a result, we have no option but to keep rand() to get 
truly random coordinates.)
